# UK_accidents_analysis
Data Analytics Project using Python (EDA and Insights)

## Goal
The goal of this project is to formulate a business challenge and use my python skills to generate insights that can produce actionable recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset has been downloaded from a Datacamp competition. The csv file for the same is in the repository.

## Situation 
Department of Transport are looking into how they can reduce the number of major incidents in UK. The safety team classes major incidents as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties. They are trying to learn more about the characteristics of these major incidents so they can brainstorm interventions that could lower the number of deaths. 

## Task
Perform an in-depth analysis that answer the following:
1) What time of the year do major accidents occur
2) What time of day and day of the week do most major incidents happen?
3) Are there any patterns in the time of day/ day of the week when major incidents occur?
4) Do external factors effect the occurence of major incidents?
5) 4) On what areas would you recommend the planning team focus their brainstorming efforts to reduce major incidents?
